### Purpose

The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate the ability to incorporate all of the human centered data science considerations learned in the course and create research artifacts that are understandable, impactful, and reproducible. A successful project will take the form of a well-written, well-executed research study document.

### Overview of the Analysis
The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted human behavior at a magnitude previously unseen in modern history. While much of the impact was negative, there were a number of positive impacts resulting from the large-scale change to our daily lives. We saw a massive shift to remote work, the implementation of lockdowns and stay-at-home orders, and restrictions on travel. This resulted in a decrease in the number of people commuting to work and an overall reduction in traffic volume. Ideally, drastically fewer cars on the road would result in fewer traffic accidents. However, itâ€™s possible that fewer cars on the road would increase traveling speed or other behavioral changes that could increase the severity of crashes. 
 
The goal of my analysis was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vehicle crash behavior in my assigned county Salt Lake County, Utah. I relied on a combination of time series analysis, data visualizations, and hypothesis testing.
